# Create Django Project with List View First
* The intent is to show that it can be useful for create the Django List View first so user can see the models presented on the page and then add links to the other pages, templates, and views.
    1. Might expand this later to use `if request.method==POST` and `if request.method==GET` somewhere.
    1. For now, create a simple template with a list as a `home` or `list` page.
